*** INTRODUCTION ***

In this package you'll find some basic examples to start using ARGoS.

To run an experiment with ARGoS, you need to define two things:
1. the robot controllers
2. the experiment configuration

You find example controllers in the controllers/ directory.
The experiment configuration files are located in the xml/ directory.

Currently, ARGoS supports the foot-bot (a.k.a. the marXbot), the eye-bot and
the e-puck. More robots will come in the future. All the examples, for the time
being, are implemented for the foot-bot.



*** THE EXAMPLES ***

OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE

In this example experiment, a foot-bot performs obstacle avoidance while navigating in an small
square environment.
The source files in controllers/footbot_obstacle_avoidance/ contain all the basic information
about how to write a robot controller. Follow the comments and you should grasp the first steps.
The configuration files for this experiment are two: xml/obstacle_avoidance_1.xml and
xml/obstacle_avoidance_10.xml. The first file places a single foot-bot in the environment. In
this file all the basics about the XML configuration are covered. The second file is to see
10 robots in action. This files shows how to distribute randomly 10 robots in the environment
without having to place them manually.

SYNCHRONIZATION

This example experiment reproduces the coupled oscillators of Mirollo and Strogatz. In the beginning,
the robots flash their LEDs out of sync, but over time, seeing each other's LEDs, they synchronize.
In this example you'll see how to use the camera, and how to distribute robots in a grid.



*** COMPILATION ***

In principle, you can compile your code however you want. In practice, we found that the help of a
build system makes your work much easier. In ARGoS, and in these examples, we use CMake. To compile
the examples, open up a shell, go to the directory where you unpacked the tar.bz2 file and type:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

If you find no error, you're ready to go to the next phase.



*** RUNNING THE EXAMPLES ***

To run an example, the configuration files have been written with the hypothesis that you run them
in the directory where you unpacked the tar.bz2, NOT in the build/ directory. Therefore, go to that
directory and type:

$ launch_argos -nc xml/obstacle_avoidance_1.xml

for the example obstacle avoidance with a single robot, 

$ launch_argos -nc xml/obstacle_avoidance_10.xml

for the example obstacle avoidance with 10 robots, and

$ launch_argos -nc xml/synchronization.xml

for the synchronization experiment.



*** WHAT'S NEXT? ***

More examples and a complete manual. I'm in the process of writing it, I do it a little bit every day. If
you have specific questions, you can contact me at <cpinciro@ulb.ac.be>.
